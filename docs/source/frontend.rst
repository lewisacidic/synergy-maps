Frontend
========

The frontend is written in JavaScript, and runs in modern (HTML5 enabled) web browsers.
It is an `angularjs`_ app, and was scaffolded using `yeoman`_, using the `angular`_ generator.
The visualization uses the `D3.js`_ library to render the images.

Dependencies
------------

The project requires the `node`_ runtime to build the app, `Grunt`_ to run tasks,
and the package managers `npm`_ and `bower`_ to install development and production
dependencies respectively.

Building
--------

To build and serve the project (having installed `node`_ and `npm`_), change into the frontend directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ npm install -g grunt bower  // install grunt and bower
  $ npm install                 // install node modules
  $ bower install               // install bower modules
  $ grunt serve                 // build and run the server

Your default browser should open by default to ``localhost:9000``, where the app is being
served.
