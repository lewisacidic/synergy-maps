Introduction
============

Synergy maps are a novel visualization technique for exploring pairwise
combination datasets, developed in the `Centre for Molecular Informatics`_
of the `Chemistry Department`_ of the `University of Cambridge`_.  This is the
documentation for an interactive implementation, written by `Richard Lewis`_,
whilst a PhD student under the supervision of `Andreas Bender`_.

Software
--------

Briefly, the data processing is done on the :doc:`Python backend <backend>`,
and the visualization is produced by the :doc:`JavaScript frontend <frontend>`:

There is a `demo`_ of the interactive frontend for some example datasets hosted on GitHub.

Paper
-----

The accompanying paper has been preliminarily been accepted into the
`Journal of Chemininformatics`_ as part of the `Mixtures and Combination Modelling thematic issue <mixtures thematic issue>`_.
